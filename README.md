           The basic steps to run the angular project : -

       1.    For creating projects , we prefer the angular CLI :-
Install the Angular CLI globally.
To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli

      2.  To create a new workspace and initial app project:
Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here
$ ng new my-app  


     3.   Angular includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.
Go to the workspace folder (my-app).
Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the --open option
    $ cd my-app
$ ng serve --open
